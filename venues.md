title: Venues
---

Venues are the sites where a performance is actually happening. What makes their representation intricate is that CIDOC-CRM distinguishes between location (`P53 Place`) and infrastructure (`E18 Physical Thing` or `E22 Man-Made Object`). In order to described such sites comprehensively here both aspects are combined. They are primarily understood and identified as a `E22 Man-Made Object` that always comes with a specific but unidentified `P53 Place`. These places optionally come with a `crm:E94_Space_Primitive` and a `crm:E45_Address`.

Venues can contain each other in that sense that a building can contain one or more specifc stages, which are connected with `crm:P46_is_composed_of`. The stages then do not come with individual places as theit location is already defined through the building they are part of.
