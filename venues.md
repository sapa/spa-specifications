title: Venues
---

Venues are the sites where a performance is actually happening. What makes their representation intricate is that CIDOC-CRM distinguishes between location (`P53 Place`) and infrastructure (`E18 Physical Thing` or `E22 Man-Made Object`), i.e. a building and its stage(s). In order to described such sites comprehensively here both aspects are combined.

Buildings (`spav:dwvhk`) and their venues (`spav:dwmkn`) are properly identified with URIs while an abstract place is attached to the building only to provide the option to add required data such as an address or the specific city a building is located in.
