## SPA Specifications

The future database of the [Foundation SAPA](https://www.sapa.swiss) will be published as linked data and build on the conceptual models [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org), [FBBRoo](https://www.ifla.org/publications/node/11240) and [RiC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_in_Contexts "Records in Context").

The implementation of these models is guided by the following ideas:

* Keep it simple
* ...

The documentation is structured along basic concepts:

* Agents (individual persons, groups, institutions)
* Works (performing arts works and their orginals such as written plays or musical compositions)
* Activities
* Objects
* Places

URIs will be structured according to these categories.

* Agents: `http://data.performing-arts.ch/**a**/id`
* Works: `http://data.performing-arts.ch/**w**/id`
* Activities: `http://data.performing-arts.ch/**a**/id`
* Objects: `http://data.performing-arts.ch/**o**/id`
* Places: `http://data.performing-arts.ch/**p**/id`
